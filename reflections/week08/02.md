## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?
  Small teams can be just as productive as a large team and communication is just as key to them.  If they don't communicate effectively they can overlap on work being done.
2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
  Small teams end up spending too much time in meetings and so they need to alter the way way they communicate using chat applications.  Small teams are also greatly effected when a person leaves the team unexpectedly, it's important that team members know all aspects of the work being done to make transitioning easier.
3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
  The unattainable triangle is 'Good-Fast-Cheap' and it is used to describe how effectively a product can be produced given the customers needs.  A good and quickly produced product won't be cheap, a fast and cheap project won't be good, and a good project that is cheap will be slowly produced.

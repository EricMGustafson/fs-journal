## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
  Unit Testing, Component Testing, and End to End Testing are the three types of testing in Vue.  Unit testing allows the testing of individual segments of code, Component testing allows the testing of Vue components, and end to end testing is the testing of the user experience, essentially the entirety of the application.
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
  I think unit testing is the most useful of the three types listed.  I feel that if you unit test all aspects of your code individually then the other two types of test become redundant and possibly unnecessary. 
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
  Competent testing is the least valuable of the testing options.  It's not useless but I think this is where the least amount of problems would arise.

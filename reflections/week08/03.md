## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?
  This is the testing of code to make sure we are getting the intended results.  Generally you test small chunks of code so that you can isolate issues easier.
2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
  Testing allows the development team to build more code with confidence.  It is also a good way to provide more documentation, explaining what failed and how you fixed it.
3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?
  A possible drawback could be that it does add time to development which could be used in other areas.  The time used also increases when you make changes to the original code because the test may also need to be refactored.

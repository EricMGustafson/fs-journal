## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
  Portfolio's provide a good way to showcase your past projects and accomplishments.  It allows your personal abilities and style to set you apart from other people.
2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
  A portfolio is most effective when using it to showcase the skills you want others to see.  If you focus on putting quality work on display instead of just anything you've created it helps sell yourself better.
3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
  Projects I would put in my portfolio are the inspire checkpoint as well as the Plan It checkpoint.  I would choose those because I feel they look the best visually and they are both projects where I felt like I started to have a good grasp on the subject matters we were learning at the time.

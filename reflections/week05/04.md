## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?
A virtual property does ont exist on a server.  They are usually functions that add tools to the schema to make them more versatile.
2. When might you use a virtual property? 
  They are useful when you want to include information on a server request automatically.  They can also be used when you want to provide functionality to things that the user would expect.
3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?
  You do not, virtual properties cannot be searched on the server.  I assume documentation is necessary to inform uses of what virtual properties are available for them to use.

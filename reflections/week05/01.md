## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?
  The query string uses key value pairs to allow a more specified search result.  The query string can have multiple key value pairs chained together.
2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
The query string begins with a "?" followed by a parameter.  If multiple parameters are needed the "&" will allow you to chain them together.
3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
  I think query will become more valuable the larger the server is.  They are a great filter tool to help direct traffic where it needs to go.

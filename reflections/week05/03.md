## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
 Timeboxing is setting aside chunks of time to do tasks.  It is meant to keep yourself focused on getting the important tasks done without distractions.
2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
  Prioritizing, swallow the frog, and the golden hour will be my timeboxing methods I focus on.  Keeping a list of things that need done is an obvious way to get things done the most efficently, this pairs well with the frog method of doing the most difficult task first.  I work best in the mornings so knowing that I can take advantage of the golden hour method.
3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 
  Timeboxing in the evening for things like nightly chores and reflections.  Setting a time limit on how long to focus on homework would help me focus on getting it done in a more timely matter.

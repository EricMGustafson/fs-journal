## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?
  One to One, this describes a relationship between to single entities.  One to Many, this describes an entity that has multiple relationships but the the relationship would only be dealing with the original entity.  Many to Many this describes situations where both entities have multiple relationships.
2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`
  If a sight has high traffic embedding can exceed file size limitations.  Linking can be used to separate the many side of a relationship into single size files.  This will reduce file size.
3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
  Things to consider are site traffic, or the size of the different entities.  If it's small you could just cross embed the multiple entities.  If it's a bigger entity it may make more sense to use an entity for a specific task.

## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
  Inheritance describes a relationship between 2 different classes.  It allows us to reuse or share code that we have written so that we don't have to duplicate the code with minor changes.
2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
  The child class inherits the parent class allowing the child to use the parent's members.  Certain members from the parent will not pass down, two of these members are constructors and finalizers.
   3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?
  The private access modifier does not pass down to the child.  The exception to this is if the child is nested in the parent class.

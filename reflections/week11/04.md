## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

  I feel ready for the final project, still a little shaky on double join statements but I think I have enough lectures to reference and get through it okay.  I plan to get as much done on this project over the first weekend and any hangups I have along the way I can work on next week.  I've enjoyed everything about this course, the staff is awesome, the course was challenging but very rewarding, and my classmates were an amazing group of people to be around.

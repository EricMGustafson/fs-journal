## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?
  This is where a user sends a SQL string through an input field to the database.  This is usually a form of malicious data that can be used to create/modify/delete data.

  Injections can be stored in cookies from local data that get picked up by web application, attacks can also be sent through headers on the Http side.  Second order attack, where the initial sanitization will miss the injection and the injection will be call by something else further down the line.
3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?
   Firewalls and intrusion detection systems can both detect injection attacks.  A lot of sanitization can be done by reducing user privileges and by using tools like Dapper.

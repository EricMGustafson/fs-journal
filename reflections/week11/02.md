## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
  The primary key is what MySQL uses to identify each table with, it must be a unique key that will not be duplicated in that column.  The foreign key is what MySQL uses to match different tables together.
2. What is an `Alias`?
  An alias is a shortened version of a table in a MySQL statement.  It is declared after the first use of a table following the declaration (accounts a).
3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)
  SELECT
  dr.*
  p.*
  d.id AS doctorsId
  FROM doctors d
  JOIN patients p ON d.patientId = p.id
  JOIN doctors dr ON p.doctorId = dr.id
  WHERE d.patientId = @id
```

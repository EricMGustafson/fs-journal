## Questions

1. What is a nested route?
  A nested route is when you are linking components within other components.  This allows much more dynamic websites and takes more advantage of the SPA structure.
2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
  I would think things like modals with forms are a good example of nested routes.  Another possibility is when a news website has other stories ready to display while you are accessing the main story.
3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
  You can pass parameters through the URL.  This a good way to transfer something that may be unique to a user's visit like a shopping cart or an account details page.

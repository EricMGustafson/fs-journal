## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?
  It is the encapsulation of code into smaller and more manageable chunks.  It is a replacement for the traditional MVC format and instead uses a 'vertical format'.
2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
  Because the components are smaller they can directly refresh the things they need to in an easier fashion.  Components are also very reusable and can be swapped in to several places in an app.
3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
  Because they hold the template script and style files all on one page components can get very unreadable very quickly. They are apt to over engineering as well.

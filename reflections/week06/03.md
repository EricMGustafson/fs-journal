## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?
  Lifecycle hooks are where you can 'hook' into the rendering and deconstructing of components on pages.  An example of a hook in use is onMounted, where you can fire off calls to the server that you want to happen immediately.
2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
  The main lifecycle hook I've used is setup().  It's where I create variables and functions that are being used on the page/component.
3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
  Mounting give full access to the component, templates and rendered DOM. There are a few different hooks that can be accessed at different stages of the lifecycle, the main one I uses is the onMounted which is a hook after the components have rendered.

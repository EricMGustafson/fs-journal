## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
  We used pair programing the most, it worked out well and I enjoyed watching the way another person coded.  It took us a bit to warm up to the idea of sharing a single computer to do the project but got easier to do as the week went on.
2. What went well this week?
  Our communication was really good this week.  We had a couple minor disagreements but had no issues working through them.  Our work flow was really great too, we both were really focused when it came to inputting code.
3. What would you do differently?
  There were a few times where we would get stuck and not know how to proceed.  We should have time boxed better and either moved on to other tasks or sought out help from teachers much quicker than we did.

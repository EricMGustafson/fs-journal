## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
  Pair programming is single terminal/keyboard with two developers.  The roles are navigator and pilot.  Navigator should be helping guide the flow of the development while watching and pilot should be coding out loud while typing.
2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
  When pair programming the code is written with better quality.  This technique also allows the project to be understood better by both team members.  
3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
  The cost benefit is not clear at this point and certainly doesn't add up if the technique is not implemented properly.  It is also possible that one of the pair may become un-engaged with the process and not input their part.

## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
  Pending, the first state of a promise, the promise is waiting for response from the api.  Resolved, this is when the promise has succesfully retrieved the api data.  Rejected, this is when the promise encountered issues with the promise and failed to retrieve api data.
2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
  Promises can use chaining to attach callbacks together, making the code cleaner and easier to manage.  'Callback hell' is when asynchronus code is passing functions, this is messy and can lead to mistakes. 
3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
.then() is code that is waiting for a the retrieval of other code before it can begin it's process.  .catch() is what receives errors from the API when something didn't process correctly.

## Questions

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
  Asynchronous means functions can run out of order or at the same time as others.  Callbacks are functions that rely on the output of asynchronous code and cannot complete until the async code finishes it's task.
3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
  Shallow code, keep functions simple and avoid nesting. Modularize, break code down into smaller sections and separate them into individual files.  Handle Every Error, attempt to write code that have contingencies for errors.

## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
  Rest stands for REpresentational State Transfer.  It is a convention for website/API design.  It stresses ease of use and simplicity for easy understanding.
2. What does Stateless mean?
  Stateless means the API server doesn't store an data about who accessed the server or what they retrieved. Because of this, each request must be uniform and complete.
3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
  The URL will include an identifier for the data being sought.  It will also include the target for the get method, usually something more specific.

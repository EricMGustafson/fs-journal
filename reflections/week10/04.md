## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
  An enum is a way to categorize data sets with meaningful names for easier understanding.  When working with numbers, adding enums can make your data easier to identify and interpret.
2. How can you modify an Enum?
  When creating an enum you can change its type to other number types.  You can also iterate over objects with enumns for alternative ways to access the data.
3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
  Have not used enums yet but I think I could find a way to add some.  Things like recipe category on the AllSpice checkpoint could use an enum to help sort all the various types of recipes.

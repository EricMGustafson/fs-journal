## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
  A row in SQL is an entire object and all of it's key value pairs.  A column is a is every key value pair from the entire table across all objects.
2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
      id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      age VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      description TEXT NOT NULL
    ) default charset utf8;
3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
Delete from deletes a row from a table using the WHERE operator to determine which row needs to be deleted.  Drop table means that you delete the entire table and its contents.

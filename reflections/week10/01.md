## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
  Value type which is stored in memory for each method that calls the data.  Reference type which creates a duplicate data type that references itself. The third is pointer type.
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
    The value type data types are bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort.  The most obvious difference is the 10+ different data types for number.  C# also seems very focused on memory usage.
3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
    Reference types create a spot in memory to be stored at but the variable only saves a pointer to the memory location.  Value types are where the memory storage is and space gets allocated for each time a value data type is called.

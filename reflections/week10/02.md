## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?
  A list in c# operates very similarly to arrays from javascript.  You create a list with a set data type and then manipulate the list using methods to add/remove copy etc.
2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
  I feel like add or remove will be the most used, simply because that is the most basic way to interact with an array/list.  I will also get use out of the find methods, being able to find specific list entries is critical when targeting specific items.
3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
  By using the find method you could get the items on a list.  There are several different versions of find and you could retrieve items in different ways.

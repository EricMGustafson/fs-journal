> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
  The observer pattern solves the issue of updating multiple elements and keeping them in sync.  You through this pattern you can update an entire app with one click of the mouse.
2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
  The observer which is what watches the AppState and executes functions when there are changes.  The listener which is flagged and sets the changes to the AppState.  The brodcast which executes events.
3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
  The data comes from the Model where we also create the template of where to inject the data to the DOM.  The controller is what communicates with the DOM and the serices and models.  When a change needs get issued from the DOM the info can be parsed in the controller and then sent to services which manipulates the data as needed.  Services then send info back to through the controller who returns it to the DOM.

## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
  The get operation which will be called on when the object in the proxy is trying to be viewed.  The set operation which will be call on when when there is an attemp to add to the object.
2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?
  A default feature of the get operation is to return the value stored within.  There should be two parameters when accesing a Get, the first for the object and another for the key that the holds the value needed.
3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  We are able to use our proxy to create a instance of the AppState.  This allows us to use the observer pattern and update our AppState easily.

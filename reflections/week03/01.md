## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
  Modules are closed off from each other.  Using exports and imports allows the using of functions and variables from other modules.  
2. How does export differ from export default?
  Export can be done in 3 different ways.  You could export just the specific value you need buy typing export before the function or class. You could group multiple values at once (export {}). Or you can export default which will export everything available to be exported
3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
  The module system has many advantages, breaking code down in to smaller chunks making them easier to manage or debug.  Eases memory usage and makes naming conventions easier.

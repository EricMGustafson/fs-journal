## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
  To isolate data and methods from outside interactions.  This is useful to keep pieces of your data from interacting with unintended methods.  It also keeps it hidden from clients and others that don't have any reason to access the code.
2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
  It is not as secure in regard to hackers or other nefarious attacks.  It also relies on non-devs to understand what is going on with underscores.  This could lead to them misusing the code and cause a lot of issues.
3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
  Using an underscore before an variable or function is the common practice for this.  It is a tool used by developers to signify that these things are intended to be used internally.

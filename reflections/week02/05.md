# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Early on in the week was a slight struggle to follow the moving pieces as we got into functions but by the time Friday rolled around I felt that I had a firm grasp on the material from this week.  The checkpoint was fun, I really enjoyed linking all the variables and functions together.

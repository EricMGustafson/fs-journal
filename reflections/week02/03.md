## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
  You can write console info on the console tab of the dev tools but the most effective way to do it is to write code into the project itself.  I can put a console.log where ever I need to which allows me to see if the function or variable is giving me the expected output.
2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
  The elements tab.  This can be used in a lot of ways to figure out where to isolate issues.  You can use the inspector tool to highlight the exact thing you are focusing on.  You can toggle the properties of CSS that have been applied to see how they are effecting the layout.  You can also add new properties in real time to see how they would effect the element you are focusing on.
3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
  Using the debugger tool and breakpoints.  This allows you to stop and look at the code where the problems are at.  The debugger lets you go through functions 1 step at a time which allows you to see what data variables and functions are passing through.

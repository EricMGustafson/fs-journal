## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
  Function Declaration- function name() {} when written this way it allows the function to be hoisted throughout the document.
  Function Expressions- let name = function () {} these functions are stored in a variable and are not hoisted.
  Arrow Function Expression- let name = () => {} a different way to write function expressions. Does not create a this value.
2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
  Parameters are the names used when creating a function, they are where the arguments are passed through when the function is invoked.  Arguments are the values that are going to be run through the parameters into a function.
3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
  Higher order functions are functions that take other functions as an argument/parameter.  Array filters are an example of this.

## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
  Scope is the availability of variables and functions.  Global scope is a variable that is created outside the body of a function and can be used/iterated by other things.  Local scope is a variable that is created inside of a function and is only available to the function it exists inside of
2. What is Hoisting ?
  Hoisting is when a variable or function has been created but they are below (in the scope of the code) where they are being called upon. For variables, they cannot be used before they have been initialized where functions will be used no matter if you call them before or after their declaration.
3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
  Var would be used in situations where I would need a variable that can be manipulated through out the document.
  Let is the one I will be using the most as it is less easily manipulated.  It is also blocked scoped so I can use them in functions without worrying about where things will change in the rest of my code.
  Const cannot be changed so I will use them when I have a variable that I don't want to be manipulated.  The exception being that array and object contents can be changed.

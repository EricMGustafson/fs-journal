## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
  Minimal design decisions, I have the tendancy to overdo design so taking a minimal design approach will help me keep things simple while still looking nice.
2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
  https://www.justinmind.com/blog/web-design-blogs/ -- a list of 50 various design blogs.
  https://www.awwwards.com/blog/design-illustration/ -- covers various aspects of web design with different articles
3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
 A well designed website can help highlight where a user needs to direct their attention.  Using colors and design flow (using subtle color and boldness changes) can naturally make a user understand a design direction.

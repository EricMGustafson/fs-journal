# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

It was a good first week, took a bit getting used to the format of how the course will play out.  Now that I'm at the end of the first week I'm feeling good about the pacing and have a better grasp on how I need to focus my learning.  I'm still struggling with positioning divs but outside of that I feel that I have a good grasp of HTML/CSS with bootstrap.

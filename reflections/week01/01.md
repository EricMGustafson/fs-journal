## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
  Git allows us to store our code on their cloud.  This gives us the ability to work on our project from any location/computer as well as easily sharing our project with team members.
2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
  Multiple branches allows the separation of commits so new ideas can be worked on without effecting the main branch.  This also makes it easier for team members to work on a project together so they can enter their own code without affecting their team mates work.
3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
  Git is the program that stores the repositories locally and allows it to be stored remotely as well.  Github is the remote repository online storage where code from Git is stored for everyone using the program.

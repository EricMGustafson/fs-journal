## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
  Psuedo-Classes apply special rules when an element meets certain requirements.  I would think the more common ones I will use are :hover and :visited.
2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
  Specificity is the priority in which CSS rules are applied to different tags.  
3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
  Inherited properties will not apply in situations where they should because !important always override specificity.  So CSS rules will not apply where you would expect them to.

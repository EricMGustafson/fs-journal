## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
  We have used trello for our scrum processes, using it to mark the things we complete as we go.  We used figma to mock our site and have worked off of that throughout this project.
2. What went well so far?
  Our planning has really planned out and while we did spend two full days figuring it out the project has moved along very smoothly since.  Our use of outside tools like chart.js and firebase have gone very well for us as well. 
3. What would you do differently? Why?
  The main thing is for me is that I think our group size is a little big and I would have preferred a smaller size (I understand that it isn't an ideal class size for 3 groups), it feels like at times our group doesn't quite have enough for 5 people to keep fully busy.

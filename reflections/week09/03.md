## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?
  It is a way to store image data in binary.  It is an older way of storing data from the time before the internet became much more efficient at passing data.
2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?
  In modern times websites use local storage to store images so they don't have to be sent every time someone returns to a site.  Base64 can't be stored locally so they have to be sent and retrieved every time a user returns to the page.
3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?
  Base64 was designed to take advantage of what technology early websites could handle.  When technology became better the base64 images actually started to take up more room that a standard file.

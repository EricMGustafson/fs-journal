## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?
  They are a way to monitor and automate specific actions on Github.  You create workflows by creating one or more text files that have a series of commands that execute when specified actions are performed.
2. What benefits do Github actions provide?
  You can run tests, handle build tasks, or even push your site the the hosting platform.  This is a nifty way to update other platforms without actually possessing them.
3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?
  There is the 'on' trigger, this is what watches what you've assigned to it and what fires off the rest of the processes.  There is also a 'jobs' trigger that are the actual processes that run when on trigger is flagged.
